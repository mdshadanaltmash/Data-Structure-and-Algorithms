"""
Given an array arr[] of integers, the task is to find the Next Greater Element for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array.
Note: The Next Greater Element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side of x in the array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider the next greater element as -1.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 2, 4]
Output: [3, 4, 4, -1]
Explanation: The next larger element to 1 is 3, 3 is 4, 2 is 4 and for 4, since it doesnâ€™t exist, it is -1.


Input: arr[] = [6, 8, 0, 1, 3]
Output: [8, -1, 1, 3, -1]
Explanation: The next larger element to 6 is 8, for 8 there is no larger elements hence it is -1, for 0 it is 1 , for 1 it is 3 and then for 3 there is no larger element on right and hence -1.


Input: arr[] = [50, 40, 30, 10]
Output: [-1, -1, -1, -1]
Explanation: There is no greater element for any of the elements in the array, so all are -1.
